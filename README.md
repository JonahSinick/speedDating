speedDating
===========

I wrote this code to analyze a [rich data set](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/examples/speed.dating/) compiled by Columbia business school professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper [Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/emir.kamenica/documents/genderDifferences.pdf). My core intent was to predict when two speed dating participants will express interest in exchanging emails with one another, assuming that one had data on them from previous similar events. I published my [first blog post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/leh/using_machine_learning_to_predict_romantic/) on my findings on December 17th 2014, and over the upcoming weeks I'll go into greater detail.
